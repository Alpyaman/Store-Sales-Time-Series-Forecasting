## Technical Details

### Feature Engineering Pipeline

1. **Time Trend Features**
   ```python
   dp = DeterministicProcess(index=dates, constant=True, order=1)
   ```

2. **Seasonal Components**
   ```python
   # Day of week seasonality
   day_features = pd.get_dummies(dates.dayofweek)
   
   # Annual seasonality with Fourier terms
   fourier = CalendarFourier(freq="A", order=10)
   ```

3. **Holiday Features**
   ```python
   holidays = holiday_events.query("locale == 'National'")
   holiday_features = pd.get_dummies(holidays)
   ```

### Model Training
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression (no intercept)
- **Format**: Wide format with 1,782 columns (33 families × 54 stores)
- **Regularization**: Non-negative predictions via clipping
- **Validation**: RMSLE on random sample

### Prediction Pipeline
1. Generate features for test period using same transformations
2. Predict in wide format (16 dates × 1,782 combinations)
3. Stack to long format and merge with test IDs
4. Handle data type mismatches for proper merging
